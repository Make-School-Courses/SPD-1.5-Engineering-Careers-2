## [**30m**] 💻 **Activity**: Design Checklists (Part 1)

1. Visit [Checklist Design](https://www.checklist.design/) in your browser.
1. Remember the portfolio project you evaluated last time we met? Open it up in your IDE of choice.
1. Select **one checklist** from [Checklist Design](https://www.checklist.design/) that are relevant to your project.
1. Evaluate your project based on the checklist.
1. Open [Gradescope](https://gradescope.com) and select the `Portfolio Project: UI Enhancements` assignment. Use the data you collected to complete the first half of the worksheet.


**PROTIP**: Make sure to run your project locally and evaluate each checklist item visually. Don't just guess based on the code you've written! Verify the feature _actually works_ by using it.
