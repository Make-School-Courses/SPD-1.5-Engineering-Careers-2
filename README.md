## Resources

- **User Interviews** - user interviews help you understand and validate user needs. Here are user interview [best practices](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xtUGbErF315eKkvVAstTnWzoXLmpygtf6YGTEMYwg_A/edit#slide=id.p) and a [template script](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uRRKejC3Ullk5vdw9P1SHmE56CGkekH2dIaoBV9ISeM/edit)
- **Best Practices for User Narratives, Wireframe, Entity Relationship Diagram** - see [best practice articles, videos, and slides](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uCxdv8N0TltGNS1YLOS8SkD0uLcir0Wg2I9pxS_PL_w/edit#) See [class slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ALBDn3bIycimyvnB6fEOAMadDOCA4wmoOO9Z-lpBRsM/edit#slide=id.g3e71f5355a_0_26) here.

Led by the PM. Team checks their roadmap and evaluate teams’ needs to decide what goes into the next sprint, and assign tasks. Teams can use [planning poker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_poker) to estimate task effort. Everything is logged into Trello. You can copy this [Sprint Planning Trello Board template](https://trello.com/b/AU9r774H/kanban-board-template).
- **Sprint Retrospective (½ hour, weekly)** - *[Meeting Agenda Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n6IDYJ9jW2lWaTu5uf7qXEd3ihgQIByxsr-4RHjldBI/edit#heading=h.10t6cnudbcpw)*. Complete the old sprint board by checking all tickets and moving incomplete ones over to the next sprint board. Then estimate the tickets that the PM have moved into the board ahead of meeting. Go over what was completed, what went well not if it didn’t go so well, but double check how everyone felt. Anyone feel overloaded on work? Anything the PM could have done differently?

## Class Assignments

### Take Home Coding Project

**Due: Tues June 9th**

A common interview practice is to assign a take home project for the interviee to complete. You're typically given a prompt or spec to follow, and a deliverable date or timeline. Through this assignment, our goal is to give you practice with a take home project with the same conditions you'd find in a real interview scenario.

[Here are the requirements](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F3LByW-A1pSpviBL4g3u9VMVuoUjxi1dUmOC_Sczg2U/edit) for the take home interview project. 

### MVP due June 23rd
MVP for iOS and Web products:
- one functional and live feature (for iOS submit link to TestFlight or screencast of local functioning of app feature)

MVP for a DS project means:
- You've got your data set
- You've cleaned it and have some initial analysis
- If you are doing a DS-based product (not analysis) then MVP means a proof of concept.
